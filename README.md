# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
BootCamp Challenge Week11
## Overview
  We helped Dana, an UFO enthusiastic, building an interactive  page that displays information about UFO sightings according userÂ´s selection. The data is stored in a JavaScrpt file and contains information about the date, city, state, country and even the shape of UFO occurrence, and a brief description along that. In the first stage we can filter only by date. Now, the user of the page may specify the place, date or time of the sighting also.
 
## Results
  We modify the original Canvas project adding another filters to perform very specific search, due we have a huge amount of data!!.
