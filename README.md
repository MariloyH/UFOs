# UFO Sightings with JavaScript 
BootCamp Challenge Week 11
# Overview
  We helped Dana, an UFO enthusiastic, building an interactive  page that displays information about UFO sightings according user´s selection. The data is stored in a JavaScrpt file and contains information about the date, city, state, country and even the shape of UFO occurrence, and a brief description along that. In the first stage we can filter only by date. Now, the user of the page may specify the place, date or time of the sighting also.
 
# Results
  We modify the original Canvas project adding another filters to perform very specific search, due we have a huge amount of data!!.

We added  filters by city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs sightings: 

**FILTER BY STATE**

**FILTER BY COUNTRY**

We can even combine filters!!

**FILTER COMBINED**

# SUMMARY
This project was a very interesting exercise about JavaScript and  Front End Development. The resulting dynamic Web Page has all the data we need, but It has sever the drawback that the data its not in real time. It could be awesome if we could know the most recent sightings! Another disavantage that I see its that we have to know exatly what we are looking for, i.e. place or shape. May be for the plces it could be too restrictive, but in the case of the shape, maybe we don´t know which shapes UFO sightings have been.  This leads me to suggest the following for a future version:
  1. A dropdown menu for filters.
  2. A pop up window if there are not results of the applied filter.
  3. A map that shows the places where the UFO sightings habe been occurred.
