# UFO Sightings with JavaScript 
BootCamp Challenge Week 11
# Overview
  We helped Dana, an UFO enthusiastic, building an interactive  page that displays information about UFO sightings according user´s selection. The data is stored in a JavaScrpt file data.js and contained information about the date, city, state, country and even the shape of UFO occurrence, and a brief description along that.We coded in JavaScript, HTML and BootStrap.  In the first stage we can filter only by date. Now, the user of the page may specify the place, date or time of the sighting also.
 
# Results
  We started from the Canvas project and we added another filters and response the filter selecction to perform very specific search, due we have a huge amount of data!!.  For miminimize errors, due some data its storage in lowercase, we transformed the user selecction in order to match the data.

We added  filters by city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs sightings: 

**FILTER BY STATE**

**FILTER BY COUNTRY**

**FILTER BY SHAPE**

We can even combine filters!!

**FILTER COMBINED**

# Summary
This project was a very interesting exercise about JavaScript and  Front End Development. The resulting dynamic Web Page has all the data Dana asked us for, but the data its not in real time. It could be awesome if we could know the most recent sightings! Another disavantage that I see its that we have to know exatly what we are looking for, i.e. place or shape. May be for the places it could be too restrictive, but in the case of the shape, maybe we don´t know which form are been presented. Also, it could be awesome if we can see on a map where were the sightings, or even better, a small video of one specific sigkting. This Web page has a lot of potential!!! 

## Drawback 
  1. Its not real time data.
  2. You need to be very specific in order to find the data.

## Recommendation
  1. A dropdown menu for filters.
  2. A pop up window if there are not results of the applied filter.
  3. A map that shows the places where the UFO sightings habe been occurred.
